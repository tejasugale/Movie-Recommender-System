# Movie-Recommender-System

Recommender Systems, also labelled as recommendation systems, are statistical algorithms that recommend products to users based on similarities between the buying trends of various user or similarities between the products.

Collaborative Filtering- The process used to calculate similarities between the buying trends of various users or similarities between products is called collaborative filtering.

User based collaborative filtering- If two user X and Y, like products A and B and there is another user Z who likes product A, then the product B will also be recommended to user Z

Item-based collaborative filtering- In this products are recommended based on similarities between themselves. For instance if a user likes product A and product A has properties X and Y, another product B with properties X and Y will also be recommended to the user.
